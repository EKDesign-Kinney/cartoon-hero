		<h2>Bibble's Friends</h2>
		<p>There's a common misconception that Bibble is merely a side-character. In fact, if you have a direct line to God you will know that he is the most important and interesting character in the entire BCU, and therefor, in a sense, the main character of the entire franchise. However, Bibble does have some nice friends. Click on the links below to read about them.</p>
